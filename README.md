# Lua-BoolExpr

by AGD

<br/>

## Description

Lua-BoolExpr is a Lua library for handling boolean expresions. Its usage could range from simple to complex but the main motivation for creating this library is to have a convenient way of representing [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate) using functions that return a boolean value.

<br/>

## Requirements

- None

<br/>

## Installation

This library is only composed of 1 module so the fastest way to use this library is to copy [src/boolexpr.lua](src/boolexpr.lua) and include it into the working directory of your project.

Optionally, you can use install this via [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/) with the following command:

```luarocks install lua-boolexpr```
